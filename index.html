            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Oscar Sepp. I have a passion for making programming simulations, be it physics for the visual effect or games to
                 find the best strategy and automation of tasks which are repetitive. I graduated from Lund University with a bachelor in physics where I mainly learnt physics, math,
                 data analysis and programming (python).

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Below are some of my projects which I have done over the years.</p>

                    <h3>Vicious Walker</h3>
                    <p>The vicious walker is a simple model for chemical reactions as these processes require molecules to meet and react.
                        This model contains walker in an n dimensional space on a grid and they move
                        every time step in a random direction. When they meet they annihilate. In this project 
                        I have studied the time frame of these reactions as well as what I have called a friendly
                        walker.
                    </p>
